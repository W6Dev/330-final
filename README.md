#How do I approach designing software? 
##What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Luckily, I am very skilled in working in the Cartesian plane. I have programmed CNC machines for over 18 years, and my knowledge of working with coordinates helped me immensely during this course. 
##What design process did you follow for your project work?
During this project, I started simply the scaled-up. I started with a cube, moving it around, changing its color, and adding textures. This helped me when I began to work with more complex shapes.
##How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The course layout was valuable, requiring us to accomplish a little every week. I built my confidence by seeing the project build a little every week. I may lay out milestones and work to complete them in the future.
#How do I approach developing programs? 
##What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I significantly developed my debugging strategies while working on this project. Chasing bugs and typos took up a lot of time, but I also learned to effectively use print statements and check the sizes of arrays to find problems.
##How did iteration factor into your development?
During the different iterations of my project, I began to modularize as many functions as possible. I believe in DRY, Don’t Repeat Yourself and think it is essential to reuse functions.
##How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones that led you to the project’s completion?
While I modularized as much as possible, passing variables back and forth did cause some problems. I wrote the shaders as single-file functions.

#How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 
##How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills to be applied in your future educational pathway?
In this course, I learned how valuable math is in computer science. Much of the way we manipulated the model was through linear algebra.
##How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I plan to use computational graphics in the future to design new graphs that can communicate multiple data points in a single image.
